\title{Adjust to Table Script for A-Frame VR}
\usage{
.adjust_to_table_script()
}
\value{
A string containing the JavaScript code to be inserted into an HTML document for A-Frame VR scenes.
}
\description{
This internal function generates a JavaScript script to register an A-Frame component called
"adjust-to-table". The script adjusts the position and dimensions of a table entity based on
the model loaded into the VR scene, ensuring the table is placed at the base of the model.
}
\details{
The component is automatically registered when the function is called, but the table is hidden
by default and becomes visible once the model has been fully loaded. The table dimensions
(width, depth, and height) are dynamically calculated to match the bounding box of the model
and ensure proper positioning.

This function is intended to be used internally within the package and should not be
directly called by users.
